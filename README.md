# Draft Me Please
## College Players Drafted to NBA

# Objective
The objective of this project was to **obtain** college players and **predict** if a college player will make it into the NBA dependent on their features using **classification models**. 

In this analysis our two classes were **Non-Drafted** College Players and **Drafted** College Players. 

# Data Collection

The data was collected from:

- Basketball-reference for NBA Players
- Sports-reference for College Basketball Players

Sports and Basketball reference complete player stats date back to 1992-93

# Observations and Features

- **30,000** College players were collected during this process.
- **4450** NBA players were collected during this process
- **27** features were collected during this process

## Randomly Sampled Observations
- 2,000 College Players (2000-2018)
- 1300 NBA Players (2000-2018)

## Features

- Height
- Weight
- Positions
- Games Played
- Games started
- Minutes per
- Field Goal
- Field Attempts
- Field Percentage
- Two Pointers
- Two Point Attempts
- Two Point Percentage
- Total Rebounds
- Turnovers
- Three pointers
- Three Point Attempts
- Three Point Percentage
- Free Throws
- Free Throw Attempts
- Free Throw Percentage
- Assists
- Steals
- Blocks
- Points
- Offensive Rebounds
- Defensive Rebounds

# Questions Before Analysis

- Does height, weight and points increase your chance of being drafted?

- Did players get drafted based on the amount of games played and points or games started and field percentage?

**Target Variable**
- 
- Can the models predict if college player will be drafted to the NBA or not?

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis  - Correlation Matrix

**Positive Correlations**

- Field Percentage + Three Point Percentage
- Field Goal + Points 
- Assist + Turnovers

**Negative Correlations**
- Height + Guard
- Three pointers + Forwards and Centers
- Weight + Games Played

## Exploratory Data Analysis  - Height + Weight + Points

### 1) Does **height**, **weight** and **points** increase your chance of being **drafted**?

Observation shows when it comes to weight above 187, height above 76‚Äù, and points a large number of drafted players perform better than non-drafted players

## Exploratory Data Analysis  - Games Played + Points

### 2) Did players get drafted based on the amount of **games played** and **points**?

Observation shows players not drafted scored less points even playing the same amount of games

## Exploratory Data Analysis  - Games Started + Field Percentage

### 3) Did players get drafted based on the amount of **games started** and **field percentage**?

Observation shows players not drafted have a 
lower field percentage while still playing an even amount of games

# Conclusion 
The models were able to classify college players being
drafted to the NBA correctly with 13% of misclassified players. 

The best model that perform was the logistic regression classifier.
We can conclude we will be 82% accurate at classifying if 
a college basketball player will be able to make the NBA from 
their stats and physic. 

A few adjustments that will be made to the models will be hyperparameter
tuning, random state.
